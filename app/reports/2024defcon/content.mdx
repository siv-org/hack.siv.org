# Hack SIV â€¢ DEF CON 2024 Report

#### We are creating the [Secure Internet Voting Protocol](https://siv.org/protocol) (SIV) to enable accessible & verifiable digital infrastructure for civil society.

## Unique Challenges

We started building SIV with the awareness of the unique challenges highlighted by many in the [computer security community](https://verifiedvoting.org/internet-voting-faq/) and institutions like the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2018/09/securing-the-vote-new-report).

Since the beginning, we have worked to address these concerns and created SIV specifically as a step forward to solve many of the remaining issues.

> The National Academy of Engineering's article ["Moving to Evidence-Based Elections"](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2023/03/moving-to-evidence-based-elections#_ftn4) presents the concept of "evidence-based elections as those in which the voting system provides 'convincing, affirmative' evidence to the public that the outcome was correctly computed." It continues with saying that "the challenge of designing secure voting systems is to provide public evidence of outcome correctness while yielding no information about individual votes beyond that contained in the tally."

This is precisely what SIV is designed to achieve, and what we wanted to test by running a red-teaming contest.

## Introducing SIV

Our design philosophy is to be fast, simple, and easy to use for everyone. To protect election processes and voters' privacy, thoughtfully designed security tools are baked in by-default.

A big part of our inspiration is to create software for digital voting like what Signal Messenger has done for digital messaging.

### SIV in U.S. elections

SIV is already being used for impactful elections, having elected legislators and executives at the local, state, and national levels.

There are thousands more election administrators around the world, searching for verifiable, easy-to-use ways to allow citizens to vote and make their voices heard.

But the bar for election security is incredibly high.

### Threat Model

The threat model is adversarial Nation States, willing to expend military-sized budgets to seek any advantage available.

## HACK SIV

A key piece of fulfilling our mission is inviting a broad, critical audience to examine, evaluate, and search for vulnerabilities.

In August 2024, we were allowed to bring our technology to the [Voting Village](https://votingvillage.org) at DEF CON, one of the premier venues for uncovering weaknesses in the equipment and processes that run our public elections.

### 30,000 DEF CON hackers â€” 6 days â€” $10,000 in prizes

We invited security researchers & engineers in-person and online to attempt to find novel vulnerabilities in SIV to:

      status:
        'One person showed impressive ways to directly install spyware on-device.',
      explanation:
        'The SIV Protocol defends against vote tampering by on-device malware, but it does not protect vote secrecy from compromised devices themselves. If an attacker controls the device, they can see everything a person does with it, including using SIV. While this was previously known and documented, the Voter Interface failed to clearly warn users.',

      status: 'Not accomplished',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 42 Total Submissions, 4 Common Types

We greatly appreciate the enthusiasm and engagement of all submitters.

After careful review, we have determined that only a handful of the submissions identified exploitable weaknesses. We have already addressed the top few and are working hard to resolve all the rest.

Even the submissions that were not directly exploitable help us identify shortcomings in our documentation and communication.

In the _Detailed Information_ section below, we provide in-depth examinations of the Top Earning Submissions, along with links to all 42 submissions.

In broad strokes, there were four major categories of submissions, summarized here:

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="1) Technical Flaws in System Design">
  [Two](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/178) different
  [people](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/231) found ways in theory to
  weaken a defensive layer. These alone weren't enough to achieve any of the
  goals aboveâ€” other layers provide reinforced defense-in-depth. But they were
  both excellent discoveries in their own right, earned top rewards, and
  solutions have already been adopted for both, in collaboration with the
  discoverers.
</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="2) Vote Selling & Voter Coercion">
A few submissions centered on Vote Selling and Voter Coercion. We were quite excited to use this contest as an opportunity to test out a limited version of one of our anti-Vote-Selling solutions, a system based on bounty-rewards we call [The Vote Seller's Dilemma](https://docs.siv.org/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma). This appeared to work well enough for the $5,000 Public Vote. It did not seem like decisions were significantly compromised by vote selling, and we are excited to run a prize-awarding vote again in the future using a similar format.

We are also working on a new, additional tool against this sort of compromise that would allow SIV votes to achieve a level of coercion-resistance similar to in-person paper voting.

</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="3) Unclear Dispute Resolution Scenarios">
  A number of other people helpfully pointed out edge-cases in dispute
  resolution during post-election auditing, which need to be documented more
  clearly and rigorously.
</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="4) Supply Chain Vulnerabilities">
A few others wrote about supply chain vulnerabilities that can be further secured. We appreciate the submissions and are searching for ways to tighten up our hardware & software supply chains.

Nonetheless, one of SIV's advantages is that it offers active proof of correct results, even in the face of supply chain attacks.

  <h4 className="text-[1.5rem] font-semibold text-indigo-800/80 mb-4">
    Don't trust, verify.
  </h4>
  The philosophy underlying SIV is: even if Darth Vader is running the election infrastructure,
  anyone â€” especially voters, but also independent observers â€” can verify for themselves
  whether an election was run fairly and correctly, or not.

### Awarding Financial Prizes

As committed before the contest began, the full $10,000 in prize money has been awarded across the 42 submissions. Every submission received at least some reward.

The SIV team decided how to allocate half of the prize money, and DEF CON attendees chose how to distribute the other half, awarding $5,000 to the submissions they found most interesting through a public vote using SIV.

From August 6th to 11th, the HACK SIV announcement was retweeted by hundreds of cybersecurity organizations and individuals.

Publications like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/can-online-voting-be-secure-experts-las-vegas-try-hack-new-platform-2024-08-09/) also covered the competition, which was syndicated widely.

<TimelineHeader text="DEF CON Participant Engagement" />

During DEF CON, hundreds of attendees engaged with the SIV team daily. Dozens sat at the SIV table to attempt hacking the system. Countless people from a wide range of demographics and countries expressed enthusiasm and support for what SIV has already achieved and for the project's overall direction and goals.

At DEF CON I had the opportunity to work with SIV's election solution. Upon subjecting the system to extensive testing and making an effort to break into it, the evident conclusion was that the SIV protocol has been built from the ground up for security.

There are evident layers of security, and a well-thought-out system design that makes it highly resilientâ€”even in the onslaught of DEF CON. In the election security space positive change is scarce, those willing to adopt change are scarcer still.

Ultimately, SIV's system not only withstood rigorous physical testing but also stood firm against critics' doubts, underscoring its robust design and resilience. SIV is a refreshing take on election security in an otherwise stagnant space.
