# Hack SIV • DEF CON 2024 Report

#### We are creating the [Secure Internet Voting Protocol](https://siv.org/protocol) (SIV) to enable accessible & verifiable digital infrastructure for civil society.

## Unique Challenges

We started building SIV with the awareness of the unique challenges highlighted by many in the [computer security community](https://verifiedvoting.org/internet-voting-faq/) and institutions like the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2018/09/securing-the-vote-new-report).

Since the beginning, we have worked to address these concerns and created SIV specifically as a step forward to solve many of the remaining issues.

> The National Academy of Engineering's article ["Moving to Evidence-Based Elections"](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2023/03/moving-to-evidence-based-elections#_ftn4) presents the concept of "evidence-based elections as those in which the voting system provides 'convincing, affirmative' evidence to the public that the outcome was correctly computed." It continues with saying that "the challenge of designing secure voting systems is to provide public evidence of outcome correctness while yielding no information about individual votes beyond that contained in the tally."

This is precisely what SIV is designed to achieve, and what we wanted to test by running a red-teaming contest.

## Introducing SIV

Our design philosophy is to be fast, simple, and easy to use for everyone. To protect election processes and voters' privacy, thoughtfully designed security tools are baked in by-default.

A big part of our inspiration is to create software for digital voting like what Signal Messenger has done for digital messaging.

### SIV in U.S. elections

SIV is already being used for impactful elections, having elected legislators and executives at the local, state, and national levels.

There are thousands more election administrators around the world, searching for verifiable, easy-to-use ways to allow citizens to vote and make their voices heard.

But the bar for election security is incredibly high.

### Threat Model

The threat model is adversarial Nation States, willing to expend military-sized budgets to seek any advantage available.

## HACK SIV

A key piece of fulfilling our mission is inviting a broad, critical audience to examine, evaluate, and search for vulnerabilities.

In August 2024, we were allowed to bring our technology to the [Voting Village](https://votingvillage.org) at DEF CON, one of the premier venues for uncovering weaknesses in the equipment and processes that run our public elections.

### 30,000 DEF CON hackers — 6 days — $10,000 in prizes

We invited security researchers & engineers in-person and online to attempt to find novel vulnerabilities in SIV to:

        'The SIV Protocol defends against vote tampering by on-device malware, but it does not protect vote secrecy from compromised devices themselves. If an attacker controls the device, they can see everything a person does with it, including using SIV. While this was previously known and documented, the Voter Interface failed to clearly warn users.',

### 42 Total Submissions, 4 Common Types

We greatly appreciate the enthusiasm and engagement of all submitters.

After careful review, we have determined that only a handful of the submissions identified exploitable weaknesses. We have already addressed the top few and are working hard to resolve all the rest.

Even the submissions that were not directly exploitable help us identify shortcomings in our documentation and communication.

In the _Detailed Information_ section below, we provide in-depth examinations of the Top Earning Submissions, along with links to all 42 submissions.

In broad strokes, there were four major categories of submissions, summarized here:
