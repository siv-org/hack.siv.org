# Hack SIV â€¢ DEF CON 2024 Report

#### We are creating the [Secure Internet Voting Protocol](https://siv.org/protocol) (SIV) to enable accessible & verifiable digital infrastructure for civil society.

## Unique Challenges

We started building SIV with the awareness of the unique challenges highlighted by many in the [computer security community](https://verifiedvoting.org/internet-voting-faq/) and institutions like the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2018/09/securing-the-vote-new-report).

Since the beginning, we have worked to address these concerns and created SIV specifically as a step forward to solve many of the remaining issues.

      "Moving to Evidence-Based Elections"
    </a>
    presents the concept of "evidence-based elections as those in which the
    voting system provides 'convincing, affirmative' evidence to the public that
    the outcome was correctly computed." It continues with saying that "the
    challenge of designing secure voting systems is to provide public evidence
    of outcome correctness while yielding no information about individual votes
    beyond that contained in the tally."

This is precisely what SIV is designed to achieve, and what we wanted to test by running a red-teaming contest.

  Introducing SIV
</h2>

Our design philosophy is to be fast, simple, and easy to use for everyone. To protect election processes and voters' privacy, thoughtfully designed security tools are baked in by-default.

A big part of our inspiration is to create software for digital voting like what Signal Messenger has done for digital messaging.

  SIV in U.S. elections
</h3>

SIV is already being used for impactful elections, having elected legislators and executives at the local, state, and national levels.

There are thousands more election administrators around the world, searching for verifiable, easy-to-use ways to allow citizens to vote and make their voices heard.

But the bar for election security is incredibly high.

<h3 class="text-[1.4rem] font-semibold text-black mt-10 mb-6">Threat Model</h3>

The threat model is adversarial Nation States, willing to expend military-sized budgets to seek any advantage available.

  HACK SIV
</h2>

A key piece of fulfilling our mission is inviting a broad, critical audience to examine, evaluate, and search for vulnerabilities.

In August 2024, we were allowed to bring our technology to the [Voting Village](https://votingvillage.org) at DEF CON, one of the premier venues for uncovering weaknesses in the equipment and processes that run our public elections.
