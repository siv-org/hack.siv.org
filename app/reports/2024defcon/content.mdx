# Hack SIV â€¢ DEF CON 2024 Report

#### We are creating the [Secure Internet Voting Protocol](https://siv.org/protocol) (SIV) to enable accessible & verifiable digital infrastructure for civil society.

## Unique Challenges

We started building SIV with the awareness of the unique challenges highlighted by many in the [computer security community](https://verifiedvoting.org/internet-voting-faq/) and institutions like the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2018/09/securing-the-vote-new-report).

Since the beginning, we have worked to address these concerns and created SIV specifically as a step forward to solve many of the remaining issues.

> The National Academy of Engineering's article ["Moving to Evidence-Based Elections"](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2023/03/moving-to-evidence-based-elections#_ftn4) presents the concept of "evidence-based elections as those in which the voting system provides 'convincing, affirmative' evidence to the public that the outcome was correctly computed." It continues with saying that "the challenge of designing secure voting systems is to provide public evidence of outcome correctness while yielding no information about individual votes beyond that contained in the tally."

This is precisely what SIV is designed to achieve, and what we wanted to test by running a red-teaming contest.

## Introducing SIV

Our design philosophy is to be fast, simple, and easy to use for everyone. To protect election processes and voters' privacy, thoughtfully designed security tools are baked in by-default.

A big part of our inspiration is to create software for digital voting like what Signal Messenger has done for digital messaging.

### SIV in U.S. elections

SIV is already being used for impactful elections, having elected legislators and executives at the local, state, and national levels.

There are thousands more election administrators around the world, searching for verifiable, easy-to-use ways to allow citizens to vote and make their voices heard.

But the bar for election security is incredibly high.

### Threat Model

The threat model is adversarial Nation States, willing to expend military-sized budgets to seek any advantage available.

## HACK SIV

A key piece of fulfilling our mission is inviting a broad, critical audience to examine, evaluate, and search for vulnerabilities.

In August 2024, we were allowed to bring our technology to the [Voting Village](https://votingvillage.org) at DEF CON, one of the premier venues for uncovering weaknesses in the equipment and processes that run our public elections.

### 30,000 DEF CON hackers â€” 6 days â€” $10,000 in prizes

We invited security researchers & engineers in-person and online to attempt to find novel vulnerabilities in SIV to:

### 42 Total Submissions, 4 Common Types

We greatly appreciate the enthusiasm and engagement of all submitters.

After careful review, we have determined that only a handful of the submissions identified exploitable weaknesses. We have already addressed the top few and are working hard to resolve all the rest.

Even the submissions that were not directly exploitable help us identify shortcomings in our documentation and communication.

In the _Detailed Information_ section below, we provide in-depth examinations of the Top Earning Submissions, along with links to all 42 submissions.

In broad strokes, there were four major categories of submissions, summarized here:

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="1) Technical Flaws in System Design">
  [Two](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/178) different
  [people](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/231) found ways in theory to
  weaken a defensive layer. These alone weren't enough to achieve any of the
  goals aboveâ€” other layers provide reinforced defense-in-depth. But they were
  both excellent discoveries in their own right, earned top rewards, and
  solutions have already been adopted for both, in collaboration with the
  discoverers.
</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="2) Vote Selling & Voter Coercion">
A few submissions centered on Vote Selling and Voter Coercion. We were quite excited to use this contest as an opportunity to test out a limited version of one of our anti-Vote-Selling solutions, a system based on bounty-rewards we call [The Vote Seller's Dilemma](https://docs.siv.org/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma). This appeared to work well enough for the $5,000 Public Vote. It did not seem like decisions were significantly compromised by vote selling, and we are excited to run a prize-awarding vote again in the future using a similar format.

We are also working on a new, additional tool against this sort of compromise that would allow SIV votes to achieve a level of coercion-resistance similar to in-person paper voting.

</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="3) Unclear Dispute Resolution Scenarios">
  A number of other people helpfully pointed out edge-cases in dispute
  resolution during post-election auditing, which need to be documented more
  clearly and rigorously.
</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<CategoriesOfSubmissions title="4) Supply Chain Vulnerabilities">
A few others wrote about supply chain vulnerabilities that can be further secured. We appreciate the submissions and are searching for ways to tighten up our hardware & software supply chains.

Nonetheless, one of SIV's advantages is that it offers active proof of correct results, even in the face of supply chain attacks.

</CategoriesOfSubmissions>

<div className="p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg border border-gray-100 text-center">
  <h4 className="text-[1.5rem] font-semibold text-indigo-800/80 mb-4">
    Don't trust, verify.
  </h4>
  The philosophy underlying SIV is: even if Darth Vader is running the election infrastructure,
  anyone â€” especially voters, but also independent observers â€” can verify for themselves
  whether an election was run fairly and correctly, or not.
</div>

### Awarding Financial Prizes

As committed before the contest began, the full $10,000 in prize money has been awarded across the 42 submissions. Every submission received at least some reward.

The SIV team decided how to allocate half of the prize money, and DEF CON attendees chose how to distribute the other half, awarding $5,000 to the submissions they found most interesting through a public vote using SIV.

<TimelineHeader text="Media Coverage" />

From August 6th to 11th, the HACK SIV announcement was retweeted by hundreds of cybersecurity organizations and individuals.

Publications like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/can-online-voting-be-secure-experts-las-vegas-try-hack-new-platform-2024-08-09/) also covered the competition, which was syndicated widely.

<TimelineHeader text="DEF CON Participant Engagement" />

During DEF CON, hundreds of attendees engaged with the SIV team daily. Dozens sat at the SIV table to attempt hacking the system. Countless people from a wide range of demographics and countries expressed enthusiasm and support for what SIV has already achieved and for the project's overall direction and goals.

At DEF CON I had the opportunity to work with SIV's election solution. Upon subjecting the system to extensive testing and making an effort to break into it, the evident conclusion was that the SIV protocol has been built from the ground up for security.

There are evident layers of security, and a well-thought-out system design that makes it highly resilientâ€”even in the onslaught of DEF CON. In the election security space positive change is scarce, those willing to adopt change are scarcer still.

Ultimately, SIV's system not only withstood rigorous physical testing but also stood firm against critics' doubts, underscoring its robust design and resilience. SIV is a refreshing take on election security in an otherwise stagnant space.

## Security Is A Process

Bruce Schneier, an influential cryptography and security author, has a famous maxim:

> Security is a process, not a product.

This is what HACK SIV is all about â€” why we have made the SIV source code public, why we brought it to DEF CON to be attacked, and why we'd like to continue running similar contests in the future.

<Details title="Contest Rules" readTime={1}>
The detailed rules for the HACK SIV contest were published on [HACK SIV contest rules](https://hack.siv.org/rules).

In summary, $10,000 in prize money was committed to be awarded in full, regardless of submission quality.

Vulnerabilities were reported publicly on [SIV's GitHub](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+created%3A2024-08-06..2024-08-11) for full transparency.

Half of the $10,000 prize was awarded by the SIV team based on criteria such as impact, scalability, and the complexity of the attack.

The other half was allocated through public voting using the SIV system. Only DEF CON attendees were eligible to vote, with a strong "One Person, One Vote" process detailed below under _"How The HACK SIV Contest Was Structured"_ > _"Public Prize Awarding Process"_.

For the Public Vote, we also [used one of our anti-vote-selling solutions](https://hack.siv.org/rules#the-vote-buying-elephant-in-the-room), based on game-theory, to disrupt trust between would-be buyers and sellers. Also detailed below under _"How The HACK SIV Contest Was Structured"_ > _"Public Prize Awarding Process"_ > _"Anti-Vote-Selling"_.

</Details>

<Details title="Hacking Resources" readTime={0.5}>
When the contest officially opened, SIV provided the following resources for people to evaluate and test the system:

- [HACK SIV Landing Page](https://hack.siv.org)
- [Illustrated Guide to The SIV Protocol](https://siv.org/protocol)
- [SIV Documentation](https://docs.siv.org)
- [The full SIV Codebase](https://github.com/siv-org/siv)
- [SIV Technical Specifications](https://docs.siv.org/technical-specifications)
- [Known Security Issues](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asecurity+)

Once DEF CON began a few days later, we also [set up a mock election](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/182) so people could poke at a live version of SIV without needing to install anything.

Although all the submissions are visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+created%3A2024-08-06..2024-08-11), understanding them in context can be challenging. To simplify this, we will highlight the top prize-winning issues and explain our approach to addressing them.

<Details title="1. Weak RNG in Auth Token Generation" readTime={1.5}>
This submission was reported by Dr. Chris Jackett
([@cjackett](https://github.com/cjackett)), a computer scientist and machine learning researcher at Australia's National Science Agency, [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/).

It highlighted a security implementation flaw in the Voter Authentication Token generation process. The Authentication Tokens are one-time codes sent by election administrators to voters to enable them to identify themselves and cast their vote.

The issue identified was that the SIV backend was using `Math.random()` to generate these, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. SIV was already aware of this issue, documented [here](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/143).

Exploiting this attack would require repeatedly hitting the production API, at a minimum hundreds of times. SIV had other logging and alerting mechanisms to immediately warn if such an attempt took place, and the team is confident that it never has. Even if it did ever take place, auth tokens can be invalidated and re-issued to remediate the issue.

Dr. Jackett also provided sample code to attempt a proof-of-concept brute force attack against the auth tokens, which was tested locally for 24-hours. Even after 24-hours of tries, this approach did not find any valid tokens.

However, highlighting this weak RNG problem and helping SIV prioritize it was valuable.

Especially admirable is that Dr. Jackett not only identified the vulnerability, but also provided a strong solution. He offered simple and straightforward code to upgrade the RNG to use cryptographically secure randomness, completely mitigating the issue, which SIV has already validated and now implemented. This also greatly validated the decision to make the full SIV codebase public as part of the prep for this contest.

In total, this submission earned a combined $1,133.36.

For the full submission details, [see its public issue](https://github.com/siv-org/siv/issues/178).

</Details>

<Details title='2. "I will pay $1 for your vote."' readTime={5.5}>

This submission, reported by Dr. Michael Specter ([@mspecter](https://github.com/mspecter)), a Computer Science professor at Georgia Tech and computer security researcher, highlighted the increased risks of vote buying and selling in a system where voters can easily verify if their vote was cast correctly.

The issue was written to demonstrate an attack against the Public Vote, where DEF CON attendees were allocating $5,000 in prize money. Because this vote was allocating money, it's particularly straightforward to _offer_ money to buy votes. This strategy could be directly profitable, enabling such an attack to quickly scale.

SIV was aware of the risks of vote selling, and had planned from the beginning to use the public Prize Awarding vote as an opportunity to test a new proposal to prevent vote buying, called the ["Vote Seller's Dilemma"](https://docs.siv.org/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma). It aims to disrupt trust between would-be buyers and sellers, by publicly incentivizing honeypots.

Dr. Specter's submission explicitly considered the Voter Seller's Dilemma mechanism. He evaluated that while it may provide benefits against:

1. _anonymous buyers_ â€” because of distrust created by incentivized honeypots
2. _prosecutable non-anonymous buyers_ â€” vote buying is a felony carrying jail-time if caught

It may not work against a Vote Buyer who is both outside of law-enforcement jurisdiction, and willing to publicly identify themselves in a reliable way. For example, this could include the leader of a hostile foreign nation. While we [had previously examined](https://docs.siv.org/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma#on-foreign-interference) this issue, Dr. Specter's submission was particularly valuable as it brought the possible threat to life.

Dr. Specter's submission had another novel element: it used the HACK SIV contest's public submissions venue of GitHub Issues to advertise the vote buying offer. While we could have closed or deleted the issue, that would not have been in the spirit of the contest â€” a point Dr. Specter preemptively highlighted. For future contests, we lean towards incorporating an additional rule that we will remove any explicit offers of vote buying, which would more closely match real-world conditions. However, since we had not established this ahead-of-time for this contest's rules, we did want to leave the submission in place.

For these helpful contributions, we awarded the issue $113 of our $5,000 allotment.

#### A key question is whether the attack actually worked or not.

6 of the 7 independent judges voted to award the issue even less than us. 1 of the 7 voted to award it $4999 of the $5000 available. On one hand, this looks rather suspicious. But it's hard to be sure, as voting for it could be genuinely and sincerely wanting to call attention to the issue of vote selling. Rather than being motivated to collect $1.

<BuyVotesImage>
  From the [Public Vote results page](https://siv.org/election/1723655385175)
</BuyVotesImage>

This contrast â€” between 6 of the 7 judges awarding the issue a relatively low amount, and 1 giving it 99.9% of their allotment â€” reflects a broader trend we've observed beyond this contest.

The vast majority of people we've spoken with â€” including citizens, candidates, and election officials â€” do not prioritize risks of vote buying & selling as reasons to reject secure internet voting. In contrast, some people view it almost axiomatically as a show-stopping problem, despite vote-by-mail ballots already being trivially easy to coerce (in addition to other problems) and in widespread use.

We don't mean to dismiss the issue out of hand, and believe those most vocal about it are genuine in their concern. We too don't want to see our governments compromised by corruption, of course. But we do hope to see more thoughtful analysis weighing the issue on both sides, recognizing the inherent compromises and trade-offs with verifiability, accessibility, and other key considerations that currently weaken our voices as citizens.

SIV has been thinking about threats of vote buying since its inception in 2020. We have attempted to provide more [detailed analysis examining the risks more holistically, especially in context compared the current status quo](https://docs.siv.org/mitigating-attacks/vote-selling).

One aspect of this issue that makes it particularly challenging is the difficulty to objectively quantify the threat, as opposed to merely theorizing about it.

In the end, in our best evaluation, we don't feel the Public Vote was compromised by this particular $1 offer.

This issue ended up earning $744 of the $5000 public allotmentâ€” approximately 15%. We had already awarded it $113, or about 2% of our allotment. So the public vote awarded it 13% more than our judgment. If this difference had been overwhelming, we could not deny its influence. But as it stands, the impact is not clear.

As of now, we would like to continue using a similar Public Vote format to evaluate future HACK SIV submissions.

#### Improving the Attack

While we don't want to see SIV compromised, in the spirit of open adversarial challenge to uncover potential threats as early as possible, we wished this particular vote-buying offer had actually been _higher_ than just $1. This could have provided clearer data showing definitive compromise.

We offer that an optimal amount might look more like "Whatever your vote awards me, minus $1". For instance, the one judge's $4999 vote divided by 7 (averaged among all the votes), would earn that seller $713.

#### Improving Anti-Vote Selling and Coercion Resistance

With all of the above said, SIV is taking the threat seriously and aims to continue testing and refining its game-theoretic solution, the ["Vote Seller's Dilemma"](https://docs.siv.org/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma).

Additionally, since the end of the HACK SIV contest, our team and several expert collaborators have started working on an additional solution, built on Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This enables a would-be seller to secretly trick any would-be compromisers. This technique works against both financial offers to buy votes _and_ physical threats of coercion, which some other contest participants had also asked about. Importantly, the external compromiser can't be certain whether a seemingly cooperative voter has actually used this capability or not.

This would allow SIV votes to achieve a similar level of coercion resistance as in-person paper voting. Even at an official polling center, voters can already photograph or video record themselves filling out a ballot a certain way as evidence for a coercer. But such photographic or video evidence can also be faked, by a particularly crafty voter. This possibility deters would-be vote buyers. Similarly, this new SIV capability can enable voters to secretly _trick_ 3rd-party coercers or would-be vote buyers.

This design also includes strong protection against abuse from malicious election administrators or malware on voters' devices. They cannot use the technique to secretly trick voters themselves.

This solution is not perfect, but in combination with the _Vote Seller's Dilemma_ bounty-reward approach, we believe a high level of defense can be achieved, disrupting voter's trust of would-be buyers or coercers, and the reverse as well.

More details forthcoming, but do [feel free to reach out](https://signal.me/#eu/BoJi_hXAgZij8SBK2mGyEoemAKKgZ7_RYOjAOnkgVYCu8IjJAH5EjblXfQ0U3Cbc) if you are interested in seeing an early draft.

In total, Dr. Specter's submission earned a total of $857.67, which he has chosen to donate to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org).

<Details title="3. Second-device malware verification check could be fooled by rerouting the QR code to another malicious site" readTime={2}>

This submission was reported by Dr. Drew Springall ([@aaspring](https://github.com/aaspring)), professor at Auburn University and an election security researcher.

It identifies a vulnerability in one of SIV's verification layers â€” specifically, the second-device check. This feature is designed to enable voters to confirm their own device didn't tamper with their vote selections maliciously.
As an additional verification method, voters can scan a QR code with a second device to double check their selections were submitted as intended.

Dr. Springall highlighted a potential attack in which the QR code used for the second-device verification could be redirected by the compromised device to a malicious site or a fake verification website.

During in-person discussions with Dr. Springall, two possible solutions were identified:

1. In civic elections where vote invitations are sent via postal mail, include a verification QR code in the mailed invitation, instead of getting it from the compromised device. This QR code would link directly to the second-device verification page, and _that_ page would capture the necessary private vote data from the first device.

2. In lower stakes non-civic elections, voters can be reminded to confirm that the second device loads the correct domain (e.g., siv.org). This requires a reliable broadcast channel to communicate with voters, which is common.

While this is one out of a few verification layers, enhancing this particular one is important. It offers voters a straightforward means to identify potential malware before preliminary results are disclosed to the public.

For those unfamiliar with SIV's election design, _"made public"_ means that everyone's vote contents (how people voted) is published as a list, without voters' identities, accessible to all. Each vote content is linked to each voters' secret Verification Number, that only the voter knows. This Verification Number then allows voters to personally find & check their vote was accurately recorded in the tally.

Example:

<VerificationNumberImage />

While other verification methods, such as SIV's [Risk Limiting Audits](https://docs.siv.org/verifiability/rla), would also catch this type of attack, addressing the issue at the second-device-check level offers earlier detection.

In the end, the two proposed solutions appear to effectively address the attack, and SIV plans to focus on implementing them.

This submission earned a total of $851.82.

<Details title="How The HACK SIV Contest Was Structured" readTime={8.5}>

<Details title="Prize Rewards" readTime={0.5}>
While planning the contest, we discussed the pros and cons of offering financial rewards for identifying vulnerabilities. We knew we wanted to reward people for their time and insight.

One concern raised was that similar contests offering financial rewards can often backfire. Too often, organizers receive numerous submissions, but in the end, claim that few or none deserve payout. This can lead to anger, disappointment, and a sense of betrayal.

To avoid this, the SIV team committed from the outset to awarding the full $10,000 amount, regardless of submission quality. This ensured there would be no debate over whether the money would be awarded or not â€” only a question of _who_ would receive it.

</Details>
<Details title="Judges" readTime={0.5}>
With that settled, the next question became: Who decides who receives awards?

To ensure fairness, we initially planned to divide the decision among three groups: a panel of expert judges, DEF CON attendees, and the SIV team.

Some people suggested we enlist third-party commercial providers, like HackerOne or similar, as independent judges. But we were skeptical they would have the bandwidth and specific product-knowledge to closely and effectively evaluate the different submissions we hoped for. Coincidentally, since our contest has ended, this was proven out with an embarrassing viral episode of low-quality triage: [1 bug, $50,000+ in bounties, how Zendesk intentionally left a backdoor in hundreds of Fortune 500 companies](https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/68ec8ed145fcee49d2f5e2b9d2cf2e52).

Due to time constraints, we ultimately decided to split the decision between two groups: DEF CON attendees and the SIV team, each deciding half of the award money.
